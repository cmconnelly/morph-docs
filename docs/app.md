## SenselApp Software
The SenselApp is your entry point for maintaining and modifying your Sensel Morph. It can be used for simple tasks such as updating firmware or visualizing the contacts and pressure, modifying existing overlays to better match your workflow, or radically transforming your overlays from their intended purpose into completely custom controllers. In short, the SenselApp can be used to execute all the possibilities of the Morph.

### SenselApp Overview

* Morphs - A list of all the Morphs attached via USB to your computer. Click on one in the list to get information about the Morph, such as serial number, firmware version, and battery level. You can also set the “No Overlay” Mode here.
* Update Firmware - A red “Update Firmware” indicates that Sensel has a new version of the firmware available for your morph. It is best to always update when possible. It only takes a couple minutes.
* Overlays - This area shows all overlays and their associated maps that you have added to the Sensel App for the selected Morph.
* Functions:
  * Add Overlay - Click this button to add a new overlay and modify the controls for any given overlay. 
  * Visualizer -  Click to turn on the visualizer to view all contacts and their pressure levels.
  * Tutorial - Toggles hints for a quick reminder of what each section is for. 
* Overlay Mapper - Shows the selected overlay and its controls for editing and re-assigning. Click on any control to fill the Inspector with current values. 
* "Send Map" Button - Click to send to the Morph any changes made to the Map with the SenselApp. 
* Inspector - Used to edit the output and behavior of any control, such as changing its type, key value, or MIDI message output.
* Top Menu - Contains functions for copying, editing, and sharing map files for the different overlays.
* Hide Left Panel - Click the "X" in the top left to hide the left panel.
